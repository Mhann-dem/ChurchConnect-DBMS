# ChurchConnect DBMS Folder Structure Explanation

## Overview

The folder structure for ChurchConnect DBMS follows modern best practices for a full-stack web application with separate frontend and backend codebases. This document explains the purpose of each directory and the rationale behind the organization.

## Root Directory

The root directory contains the following:

- README.md - Project overview and quick start guide
- .gitignore - Git ignore configuration file
- docker-compose.yml - Docker Compose configuration for development and production
- .env.example - Example environment variables template
- frontend/ - React frontend application
- backend/ - Django REST Framework backend
- docs/ - Project documentation
- nginx/ - Nginx configuration for production deployment

## Frontend Structure

The frontend follows a component-based architecture using React:


frontend/
├── public/               # Static public assets
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── admin/        # Admin dashboard components
│   │   ├── form/         # Public form components
│   │   ├── layout/       # Layout components (header, footer, etc.)
│   │   ├── shared/       # Shared UI components 
│   │   └── ui/           # Basic UI building blocks
│   ├── pages/            # Page components
│   │   ├── admin/        # Admin dashboard pages
│   │   ├── auth/         # Authentication pages
│   │   └── public/       # Public-facing pages
│   ├── services/         # API service functions
│   ├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions
│   ├── context/          # React context providers
│   ├── styles/           # Global styles
│   ├── assets/           # Static assets (images, icons, fonts)
│   ├── App.jsx           # Main App component
│   └── index.jsx         # Application entry point
├── package.json          # NPM dependencies and scripts
├── .env.example          # Frontend environment variables template
└── Dockerfile            # Frontend Docker configuration


### Key Frontend Files

- components/form/MemberForm.jsx - The public-facing member registration form
- components/admin/Dashboard.jsx - Main admin dashboard component
- pages/auth/LoginPage.jsx - Admin authentication page
- services/api.js - API service layer for backend communication
- context/AuthContext.jsx - Authentication context provider
- hooks/useForm.js - Custom hook for form handling
- utils/validation.js - Form validation utilities

## Backend Structure

The backend follows Django's recommended project structure with separate apps for different domains:


backend/
├── churchconnect/        # Main Django project
│   ├── members/          # Members app
│   ├── groups/           # Groups/Ministries app
│   ├── pledges/          # Financial pledges app
│   ├── authentication/   # Custom authentication app
│   ├── reports/          # Reporting and exports app
│   ├── families/         # Family relationships app
│   ├── core/             # Core functionality app
│   ├── static/           # Static files
│   ├── templates/        # Django templates
│   ├── media/            # User-uploaded content
│   ├── settings.py       # Django settings
│   ├── urls.py           # Main URL configuration
│   ├── wsgi.py           # WSGI configuration
│   └── asgi.py           # ASGI configuration
├── scripts/              # Utility scripts
├── tests/                # Additional tests
├── docs/                 # Backend-specific documentation
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
├── manage.py             # Django management script
└── Dockerfile            # Backend Docker configuration


### Django App Structure

Each Django app follows the same structure:


app_name/
├── migrations/           # Database migrations
├── templates/            # App-specific templates
├── __init__.py           # Python package initialization
├── admin.py              # Django admin configuration
├── apps.py               # App configuration
├── models.py             # Database models
├── serializers.py        # DRF serializers
├── urls.py               # App URL patterns
├── views.py              # API views
└── tests.py              # App-specific tests


## Documentation

The docs directory contains comprehensive documentation:


docs/
├── api/                  # API documentation
├── user-guides/          # End-user documentation
├── development/          # Developer guides
└── deployment/           # Deployment instructions


## Nginx Configuration

The nginx directory contains configuration for production deployment:


nginx/
├── nginx.conf            # Main Nginx configuration
└── conf.d/               # Server blocks
    └── default.conf      # Default server configuration


## Usage Instructions

### For Linux/macOS Users

1. Save the bash script to a file (e.g., create-project.sh)
2. Make it executable: chmod +x create-project.sh
3. Run the script: ./create-project.sh

### For Windows Users

1. Save the batch script to a file (e.g., create-project.bat)
2. Run the script by double-clicking it or from Command Prompt

### After Structure Creation

1. Initialize a Git repository:
   
   cd ChurchConnect-DBMS
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project structure"
   

2. Set up the frontend:
   
   cd frontend
   npm init -y
   npm install react react-dom react-router-dom axios formik yup
   

3. Set up the backend:
   
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers psycopg2-binary
   

## Best Practices for This Structure

1. *Component Isolation*: Keep components focused on a single responsibility
2. *API Service Layer*: Centralize API calls in the services directory
3. *Custom Hooks*: Extract complex logic into reusable hooks
4. *Django App Separation*: Each app should have a distinct domain responsibility
5. *Documentation First*: Update documentation as you develop features
6. *Environment Configuration*: Use environment variables for configuration
7. *Testing*: Write tests alongside feature development

Following this structure will help maintain code organization as the project grows and make it easier for new developers to understand the codebase.
