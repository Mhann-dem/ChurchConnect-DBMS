# ChurchConnect DBMS Documentation

## Project Overview

ChurchConnect DBMS is a custom-built Church Data Management System designed to streamline member data collection and administrative workflows while ensuring excellent usability for all user types. The system consists of:

1. A public-facing form portal for members to submit their information without requiring login - designed to be intuitive for users of all ages and technical abilities
2. A secure admin dashboard for church staff to view, search, and manage member records, pledges, groups, and events - with role-based interfaces optimized for different administrative needs
3. A robust backend API and database to store and manage the collected data
4. An integrated help system with context-sensitive guidance for all user types

├── serializers.py        # DRF serializers
├── urls.py               # App URL patterns
├── views.py              # API views
└── tests.py              # App-specific tests


## Documentation

The docs directory contains comprehensive documentation:


docs/
├── api/                  # API documentation
├── user-guides/          # End-user documentation
├── development/          # Developer guides
└── deployment/           # Deployment instructions


## Nginx Configuration

The nginx directory contains configuration for production deployment:


nginx/
├── nginx.conf            # Main Nginx configuration
└── conf.d/               # Server blocks
    └── default.conf      # Default server configuration


## Usage Instructions

### For Linux/macOS Users

1. Save the bash script to a file (e.g., create-project.sh)
2. Make it executable: chmod +x create-project.sh
3. Run the script: ./create-project.sh

### For Windows Users

1. Save the batch script to a file (e.g., create-project.bat)
2. Run the script by double-clicking it or from Command Prompt

### After Structure Creation

1. Initialize a Git repository:
   
   cd ChurchConnect-DBMS
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project structure"
   

2. Set up the frontend:
   
   cd frontend
   npm init -y
   npm install react react-dom react-router-dom axios formik yup
   

3. Set up the backend:
   
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers psycopg2-binary
   

## Best Practices for This Structure

1. *Component Isolation*: Keep components focused on a single responsibility
2. *API Service Layer*: Centralize API calls in the services directory
3. *Custom Hooks*: Extract complex logic into reusable hooks
4. *Django App Separation*: Each app should have a distinct domain responsibility
5. *Documentation First*: Update documentation as you develop features
6. *Environment Configuration*: Use environment variables for configuration
7. *Testing*: Write tests alongside feature development

Following this structure will help maintain code organization as the project grows and make it easier for new developers to understand the codebase.
